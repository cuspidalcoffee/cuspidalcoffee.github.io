# Hi, I'm Tosti
My name's Chloe Kudryavtsev, and I host toast.cafe and a bunch of related things.

I do system administration for a living.
I also do quite a bit of programming (usually in shell or lua, but I have a long list of languages I'm proficient with), writing and philosophy.

In terms of leisure, I enjoy games in the action rpg genre (like dark souls), platformers, metroidvanias and tactics games.

If you like what I do, <a href='https://ko-fi.com/cosmictoast'><img src='/img/kofi.png' style='max-height:2em;' /></a>

Oh, what makes a person "caffeinated"? Wouldn't you like to know.
