# Hello!

My name is Chloe Kudryavtsev, but I'm more commonly known as toast.
I'm an admin, developer, writer, philosopher, and general fixer.

If you want details regarding my professional experience, see the Career page in navigation.
You can consider this a CV-lite you can look through before you contact me (either with an offer or to get references or my full CV).

Want to know what kind of things I do when I'm not at work?
