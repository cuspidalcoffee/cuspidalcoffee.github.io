		<h1>How to get started on Frontals</h1>
		<p>
		A while ago, I came across a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/uitjpb/i_think_researchers_in_math_should_have_a_road/">post on reddit.com</a> encouraing researchers in math to write a roadmap that could help graduate students get an idea on how to tackle a research topic they are unfamiliar with.
		While I am far from being able to describe myself as a <emph>bona fide</emph> researcher, the idea itself stuck in my head, and found it interesting to try and write what I consider to be an appropriate collection of materials one may use in order to approach the topic of frontal hypersurfaces.
		</p>

		<p>
		Perhaps the study of frontal hypersurfaces sits best in the theory of Singularity Theory, which finds itself in the crossroad between analytic, algebraic and differential geometry.
		Which is to say, one needs to become familiar with techniques from commutative algebra, complex analysis and differential geometry, in different concentrations for each particular problem.
		For this reason, I will assume the reader has a solid background on real analysis (single and multiple variables) and single-variable complex analysis, as well as linear algebra, and has done at least one course on abstract algebra.
		</p>

		<p>
		Each subject covered will be divided into three sections: <emph>focus on</emph> (what I consider to be a fundamental tool), <emph>skim through</emph> (you do not need to understand it right now, but you will come back to this topic later) and my personal references of choice.
		Some of them I have already written about as part of my Master's Thesis, wherein I go over the basics more slowly, so the reader may use it as a basic reference.
		</p>

		<h2>Commutative Algebra</h2>
		<p>
		Commutative Algebra is the study of modules over a commutative, unit ring.
		A module is an abelian group M endowed with a ring action R -> M given by the <emph>scalar product</emph>.
		One may think of a module as a vector field where the ring is replaced by a unit (and in our case commutative) ring.
		</p>

		<!--<p>
			<lu>Spectrum: The spectrum of a ring is the collection of all its prime ideals.
			The spectrum of a ring can be endowed with the Zariski Topology, wherein prime ideals act as points.
			Unlike affine points however, prime ideals have an associated notion of <em>multiplicity</em>, which represents the number of times a geometric shape crosses itself at that point.</lu>
			<lu>Complete intersection module: a submodule N of M is a complete intersection if we can generate with as many elements as its codimension.</lu>

		</ul>

		<h2>Differential Topology</h2>
		<p>
		Many properties concerning a topological space can be derived from the properties exhibited by the maps they admit (or not admit).
		Perhaps the best example of this is the hairy ball theorem, which states that any vector field tangent to an even-dimensional sphere must vanish (i.e. be zero) somewhere.
		This is because global tangent vector fields <em>preserve</em> the Euler characteristic (as stated in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9%E2%80%93Hopf_theorem">Poincaré-Hopf theorem</a>), and a non-vanishing field can only arise in characteristic 0.
