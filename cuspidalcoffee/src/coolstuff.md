## Visualizing quaternions: An explorable video series

[Click here!](https://eater.net/quaternions/)

The quaternions are a number system that acts as a generalisation of the
complex numbers, wherein we have three _imaginary_ numbers (**i**, **j** and
**k**) that are used to describe 4-dimensional points.
The quaternions are represented by the letter **H**, and pose an example of a
number system where multiplication is not commutative - much like matrices!

This project by Grand Sanderson and Ben Eater aims to introduce an interactive
video series, where the spectator can freely interact with the animations
being shown on screen to have a better grasp of the underlying concepts.
