## Outside In - How to turn a sphere inside out

I have a challenge for you: can you turn a sphere inside out without poking
holes in it or creasing it?
It is not easy and we will need to use some out-of-this-world material, but I
certainly can!

In this video produced by the Univertsity of Minnesota's now-closed
[Geometry Center](http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/), the authors explore the notions
of oriented hypersurface, winding number and diffeomorphism through
animated illustrations.
This video is an internet classic that has spawned a number of humorous
spin-offs over the years, as well as surprised thousands of people with their
surprising transformations.

## Visualizing quaternions: An explorable video series

The quaternions are a number system that acts as a generalisation of the
complex numbers, wherein we have three _imaginary_ numbers (**i**, **j** and
**k**) that are used to describe 4-dimensional points.
The quaternions are represented by the letter **H**, and pose an example of a
number system where multiplication is not commutative - much like matrices!

This project by Grand Sanderson and Ben Eater aims to introduce an interactive
video series, where the spectator can freely interact with the animations
being shown on screen to have a better grasp of the underlying concepts.
