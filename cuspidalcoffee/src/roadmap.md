# Roadmap to...
A list of materials I recommend for learning a number of topics.
Each list is classified under three levels of depth and/or complexity.

* Introductory materials: aimed at those who have just finished the degree in Mathematics.
* Further reading: graduate-level texts I consider to be more accessible.
* Mastering the concepts: advanced materials, including bleeding-edge results.

Each level has a series of requirements labelled.
It is not necessary to have a deep understanding of the subject, but it is recommended to have some notions and references in hand.

## ...Singularity Theory
