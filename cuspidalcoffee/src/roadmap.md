# Welcome to the Roadmap!
This is a list of materials I recommend for learning a number of topics in Mathematics.
Each list is classified under three levels of depth and/or complexity; namely,

* **Introductory materials**: aimed at those who have just finished the degree in Mathematics.
* **Further reading**: graduate-level texts I consider to be more accessible.
* **Mastering the concepts**: advanced materials, including bleeding-edge results.

Each level has a series of requirements labelled.
It is not necessary to have a deep understanding of the subject, but it is recommended to have some notions and references in hand.
_Think MathOverflow, not Wikipèdia!_
