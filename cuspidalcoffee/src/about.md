# About me

[ORCiD](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3115-1851) / [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christian-Munoz-Cabello-2) / [Types.pl](https://types.pl/@CuspidalCoffee)

I am a PhD student at Universitat de Val√®ncia in Eastern Spain.
My main areas of interest as of right now are local analytic geometry, algebraic topology and contact geometry.
I am currently working on adapting (and perhaps even extending) Goo Ishikawa's [Theory of infinitesimal Legendrian stability][Ishikawa] to the framework of _pure frontal mappings_; that is, without the need of using tools from the implicit contact structure carried by the frontal mapping.

I also develop libraries for [Oscar], though my main focus at the moment is to implement my own results onto a library for ease of use.
