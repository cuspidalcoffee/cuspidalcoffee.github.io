			Outside In - How to turn a sphere inside out
		</a></h2>
		
		<p>I have a challenge for you: can you turn a sphere inside out without poking holes in it or creasing it?
		It is not easy and we will need to use some out-of-this-world material, but I certainly can!</p>

		<p>In this video produced by the Univertsity of Minnesota's now-closed
		<a href="http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/">Geometry Center</a>,
		the authors explore the notions of oriented hypersurface, winding number and diffeomorphism through animated illustrations.
		This video is an internet classic that has spawned numerous humorous spin-offs over the years, as well as surprised thousands of people with their surprising transformations.</p>

			Visualizing quaternions: AN explorable video series
		</a></h2>

		<p>The quaternions are a number system that acts as a generalisation of the complex numbers, wherein we have three <emph>imaginary</emph> numbers (<strong>i</strong>, <strong>j</strong> and <strong>k</strong>) that are used to describe 4-dimensional points.
		The quaternions are represented by the letter <strong>H</strong>, and pose an example of a number system where multiplication is not commutative - much like matrices!</p>

		<p>This project by Grand Sanderson and Ben Eater aims to introduce an interactive video series, where the spectator can freely interact with the animations being shown on screen to have a better grasp of the underlying concepts.</p>
